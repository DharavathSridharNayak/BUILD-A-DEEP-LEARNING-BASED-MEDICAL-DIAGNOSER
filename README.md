🧠 BUILD-A-DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-MEDICAL-DIAGNOSER 

This project presents an advanced deep learning-based diagnostic system designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential medical conditions using patient data and/or medical imaging. By leveraging state-of-the-art neural network architectures and deep learning techniques, the system can analyze complex clinical data patterns to provide fast, consistent, and data-driven preliminary diagnoses.

🔍 Project Overview:


The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between medical expertise and artificial intelligence by developing a scalable, intelligent diagnostic engine. The system is trained using large-scale healthcare datasets and/or annotated medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, or symptom datasets), enabling it to learn patterns indicative of specific diseases or abnormalities.


🛠 Tech Stack:

Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenCV, scikit-learn, Plotly

Streamlit/Flask for web app

Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for development.
