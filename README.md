# BUILD-A-DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-MEDICAL-DIAGNOSER
This project leverages deep learning techniques to develop a medical diagnosis system capable of identifying diseases based on patient symptoms or medical images (like X-rays or CT scans). The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect abnormalities and assist healthcare professionals in early and accurate diagnosis.
